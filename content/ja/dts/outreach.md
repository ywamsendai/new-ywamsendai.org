**During the Discipleship Training School (DTS) outreach phase, you will join with others to take the message and love of God across the world. You will learn about the diversity of cultures and will participate in God’s purposes for the places you visit.**

# Field Placement

The DTS outreach phase will give you the chance to apply the principles you learned during your DTS lecture phase. You can put all of your new perspective into action by sharing God’s truth in different places all around the world. The goal is to share the love of God which you have experienced in your own life.

# Your Outreach Location

There are many kinds of locations for DTS outreach–a whole world, in fact! Some DTS or YWAM locations will have already decided where outreach will be held beforehand. Others will decide on these locations after you arrive.

When you click on a DTS you’re interested in you’ll see a list of outreach destinations for that DTS, if they have announced this information.

# Debrief

By the time outreach ends, you will have seen and experienced a lot of new things. This is why many DTSes hold a debrief time at the end of outreach. It is a time to regroup, share stories of how God moved, and process what God did through you and others during the DTS. It’s also a time to explore your next steps after DTS.
