## Japanese identity is deeply entangled with Shinto and Buddhist culture and customs. Christianity often looks and feels Western, so the Japanese tend to view it as being a “Western religion”. Its common to hear someone say “I really like Jesus, but I am Japanese.” For the gospel to truly take root in Japan, we need to communicate the gospel in a Japanese way.

Here at YWAM Sendai, we strongly believe that in order to see a true revival of Christianity in Japan, we need to communicate the Gospel in a way the Japanese understand. Because of this, it is essential we learn the Japanese culture and language. If we really want to reach the Japanese, we need to become like the Japanese. (see 1 Cor. 9.20)

We also desire to creatively explore ways in which we can express Christian worship in authentically Japanese ways: whether in music, art, writing, symbolism, nature, or prayer.
