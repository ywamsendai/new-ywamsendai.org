After the Discipleship Training School, journey alongside a community of people who desperately want to serve Jesus in North-East Japan with their whole lives.

Invest in learning the Japanese culture and language, desiring to demonstrate the Gospel to the unreached millions you will encounter every day. Become like a Japanese, to win the Japanese (1 Cor. 9.20).

Feeling called to Japan? Consider coming to Sendai either for a few weeks, a couple of years, or longer!
