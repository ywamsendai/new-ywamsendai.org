Are you interested in volunteering with us short-term, or bringing an outreach team? That's great! You are welcome! As we are still a new and small community, we are unable to plan schedules or ministries for outreach teams. But you are welcome to prayer walk, do evangelism, and get involved in things we do regularly as a community! Individual volunteers will have a taste of what it is like to be a long-term team member with us.

Please get in touch and ask us any questions you have about coming to Sendai!
